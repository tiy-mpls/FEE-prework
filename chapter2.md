# Prework

Prework is material that ensures you have the basic foundation required for the course. Starting learning before the class is like training for a marathon. You don't show up the day of the race and start, you need to train beforehand. In our classes, your brain is the muscle that needs to train. This prework is training for your brain.

## Part 1

Signup for any accounts that you currently do no have:

1. http://github.com
2. http://twitter.com
3. http://medium.com
4. http://trello.com (sign-in with your Google account for easier access)

There is no commercial software required for the class. We will install a number of tools to be used, such as a code editor and a chat program, but they will all be free and/or open-source. 

We will also help you install software and setup your machine.

Read [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)

Write a blog post or compose a message to your instructor answering the following questions:

- Which type of mindset (growth or fixed) do you think you are most strongly associated with? Why?
- What difficulties do you predict that you will encounter during our course? How have you reacted to similar situations in the past? How do you plan on reacting to these situations during the class?

## Part 3

Read the post, slides, and watch the video series on personal branding with The Iron Yard's John Saddington: http://blog.theironyard.com/2015/02/25/bb-workshop/

## Part 4

Spend ~ 10-20 hours each week on the following online courses to round out any foundational knowledge necessary to start the class. In total, there might be 20 to 30 hours of prep needed, so if class starts within two weeks, you need to spend a little more time each day.

Start these and finish:

1. Learn to use the terminal (estimated time, 4 hours)

    The command line is an interface to the internals of your computer, as opposed to the graphical user interface (GUI) that we commonly use. We will be using the command line extensively in our class, but the point of this prework is not to be an expert, just to start to get comfortable.

    Especially if you’ve never used the command line before, you may want to go through these more than once. Make sure not just to read/watch, but really dive in and use the commands that you learn about.

    Read the following article and complete the course on Treehouse:
