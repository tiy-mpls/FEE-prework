# Introduction

Hello and welcome to the pre-work for your The Iron Yard Minneapolis cohort.

Please read and re-read this book until you feel that you understand the expectations that I have of you before the start of the course. You should be spending up to 20 hours per week in the weeks leading up to the course prepping and starting to develop the skills and mindset that are required to be successful in the course.  It is absolutely critical that you have taken steps to prepare yourself so that on day 0 we're ready to move quickly.

I look forward to meeting you all and encourage you to reach out with any questions or concerns that you have about the course.

Thank you and let's get started!
