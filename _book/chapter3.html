                        <h1 id="the-code-school-manifesto">The Code School Manifesto</h1>
<p>This document serves as a standard to which a code school may adhere. It broadly outlines the philosophy, values, and practices that should be shared by all schools. It reflects the authors&apos; hope that all code schools will become allies in a singular mission to serve, teach, enrich, and support the newcomers to the craft of programming who have put themselves in our charge.</p>
<h2 id="the-promises">The Promises</h2>
<p>We promise that our students will always be first and foremost.</p>
<p>We promise to accept into our schools only those students for whom the class will be of obvious and likely benefit when measured against the cost in time, finances, and beyond.</p>
<p>We promise to set expectations that are reasonable and fair, including workload during the course, qualifications to be gained, and job opportunities following graduation. </p>
<p>We promise to promote neither inflated nor deflated graduation rates, dropout rates, failure rates, job placement rates, graduate salaries, and long-term prospects. </p>
<p>We promise to make our instructors available to contact by the public, and to make their career experience publicly known.</p>
<p>We promise to provide, within the bounds of privacy requested by individual students, contact information for any student enrolled for any length of time, both past and present.</p>
<p>We promise to work in the open, making students&apos; coursework and projects publicly available.</p>
<p>We promise to protect our students from any employer or organization that would mistreat them or take advantage of their talents.</p>
<p>We promise to require students and staff to sign a detailed code of conduct.</p>
<p>We promise to have zero tolerance for harassment of any kind, as established in the code of conduct.</p>
<p>We promise to create a safe environment for all students and staff. To quote <a href="http://www.lambdajam.com/policies/" target="_blank">Lambda Jam&apos;s Diversity Policy</a>, this specifically means creating a safe environment for &quot;people of any gender identity or expression, race, ethnicity, size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level, neurotype, religion, elder status, family structure, culture, subculture, political opinion, identity, and self-identification.&quot;</p>
<p>We promise to collaborate with any school for the benefit of our students, whenever possible.</p>
<p>We promise to offer a legal agreement that protects both our students and our school.</p>
<p>We promise to offer fair and reasonable refund policies to students when either party cannot fulfill their agreement.</p>
<p>We promise to celebrate other schools who are known to follow these guidelines, and to celebrate any student attending a worthy school, even if it is not our own.</p>
<p>We promise to hold ourselves and each other to these standards, to accept redress when due, and to correct ourselves humbly.</p>
<p>If any of the individuals or organizations signed below falter in any of these points, we invite public accountability, and we promise to right our wrongs. </p>
